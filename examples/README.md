# Example Programs for the 2022 Supercon.6 Badge
The directory holds example programs, written in assembly, that you can use on you Supercon.6 badge. These are intended to be more complex than the examples included in the guided tutorial, and should give you a better idea on how to utilize the more advanced capabilities of the badge hardware.

We'd love to include example programs developed by the community, so if you've written an interesting piece of software for the badge, feel free to send a pull request.

Here's a useful EQUates section to add to your assembly code to get nice symbolic names for special function registers:
