# Tertis

Janky Tetris (officially named Tertis), written by hand, on paper, and typed in with
buttons, because why not...

## Overview

Exactly what the description says. It was written by hand on pen and paper, then entered
into the badge using the buttons. All testing and debugging happened on the badge. The
goal was to write Tetris without using a computer the entire Supercon weekend.

## Gameplay

This is just Tetris, but on a badge.

Use the 1 and 2 buttons on the OPERAND Y section to move right and left, respectively.
Use the MODE button on the left to turn the tetromino.

The bottom row of the display is the score counter in binary. It will show how many
tetrominoes have successfully landed.

On losing (because the tetromino stack reached the top), the score will blink forever. To
restart use the BREAK button to stop it, and then the RUN button to run it again.
