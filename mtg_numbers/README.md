First off, I figured out a lot of this by reading and examining
dice-roll by Tom Nardi. Understanding his code and making lots
of mistakes helped me get this program finished.

mtg_numbers is just a life points displaying program when playing
Magic: The Gathering.  You can increase or decrease the numbers
on the display by pressing the minus or plus buttons in the
OPERAND Y area. These are buttons 10 and 11. The program can go
up to 999 life points and to zero. Pressing the minus button
while you are a 1 life point will show DEAD on the display matrix.

After Con Badge Hacking or Badge Hacking at Home has been a fun
adventure. It has kept me in touch on the Hackaday discord
channel.

I took the badge to a Magic The Gathering tournament and used it
to show my life points. Now they want a badge, or something made
to show their life points electronically.
